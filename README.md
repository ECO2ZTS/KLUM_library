## Description
The KLUM spectral library was acquired during the summer of 2018 in Karlsruhe, Germany. It contains 181 urban material samples that consists of 12 materials and 33 subclasses. 
For additional information regarding i.e. the post-processing or the labelling, please refer to the article.

The following data is available for download:
- **\Images:** Folder containing images of each material sample
- **KLUM.pdf:** Document providing an overview of the material samples
- **KLUM_metadata.x:** File containing the essential metadata and spectra
	- **index:** Unique material label
	- **class:** Material class
	- **subclass:** Material subclass
	- **usage** Description of the material's usage (e.g. Facade, ground or roof)
	- **color:** Description of the material's color
	- **surface_structure_texture_coating:** Description of the material's surface structure, texture and coating
	- **status:** Description of the sampleâ€™s status (e.g. Weathered or New)
	- **effective_solar_incidence_angle:** Effective Solar Incidence Angle at time of acquisition
- **KLUM_spectra.x:** File containing the spectra
	- **index:** Unique material label
	- **spectra:** 1x2151 vector containing the spectral reflectance in %
	- Row 2 contains the hyperspectral bands in nm (350-2500 nm)
- **KLUM_quality.x:** File containing additional information about the quality of the post-processing
